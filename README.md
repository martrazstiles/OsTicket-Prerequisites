<p>
After CGI is enabled, install the following files from "osTicket-Installation-Files" folder in this order: PHP manager, Rewrite Module, VC redist.x86.exe, and MYSQL file. For the MySQL you will need to click Typical setup -> Launch configuration Wizard (default) -> create user and password. After installs are completed, create a new directory "C:\PHP" and unzip the folder PHP 7.3.8 inside it.

<p>
We can now open ISS as an Admin, register PHP from within IIS (PHP manager -> C:\PHP\php-cgi.exe) and reload IIS.
Install osTicket v1..15.8 by unzipping it from the installation folder and copying it in “c:\inetpub\wwwroot” then renaming it to "osTicket". Reload IIS. In ISS, click on sites -> Default -> osTicket , on the far right click on "Browse *.80" this will take to the osticket setup page. Some extensions need to be enabled, go back to IIS, click on sites -> Default -> osTicket , Double click PHP manager, click on "Enable or disabale an extension" and enable php_imap.dll, php_intl.dll, and php_opache.dll. After enabled, refesh osTicket setup page and they should be enabled.

<p>
Rename: ost-config.php
-	From: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-sampleconfig.php
-	To: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php
</p>
<p>
  Assign permissions to ost-config.php : right click file -> properties -> Security -> advanced -> disable inheritence -> add -> select principal -> enter "Everyone" then "ok" -> click "Full control" then ok -> verify permissions under "Permissions entries".

</p>
<p>
  Continue setting up osTicket in setup page, enter information (name, email, user, password). Before finishing we need to install HeidiSQL from installation folder then: open -> create new session root/root -> connect session -> create database called "osTicket". This new data base will be used by osTicket and send data into it. Continue setting up osTicket in browser and fill out the infromation (same information you netered when database was created). Click "install now" and you should have osTicket installed!! In the same page at the bottom there will be some links to verify connectivity ( osTicket URL and Staff control panel)
